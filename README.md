GIPHY-API
A web app that takes user inputs and dynamically creates buttons on the page, while at the same time allowing the user to click on the button of their choice to show a list of twelve gifs queried from GIPHY. Minor functionality issues still remain, such as the remove button removing all of the user created buttons, instead of just the last user button.
